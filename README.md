## üöÄ How it works

- A user sends a voice or video message to the bot.  
- The bot saves and converts it into .wav.  
- The audio is transcribed into text.  
- The text is summarized by a local Hugging Face model.  
- **User progress (language, scores, opened cards, statistics) is saved in `users.db` via SQLite.**  
- The user receives either the full transcript or a short, meaningful summary.
